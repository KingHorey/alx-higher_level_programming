Examples:
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)

>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
division by zero

>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(None, 3)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

>>> try:
...     matrix_divided([[1, 3, "s"], [4, 10, 3]], 3)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

>>> try:
...     matrix_divided([[12, 3], [34, 5, 10]], 12)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
Each row of the matrix must have the same size
